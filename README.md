## Learning GitHub's important commands.
---
So untill now i have learnt the following commands in git bash.

---
* git config --golbal : To set the user's email and name.
* git init: To initiliaze existing directory as a git repository.
* git add: To make git track the files for commit.
* git commit/git commit -m 'message': To commit our changes and enter a commit message.
* git log: To see the history of our commit.
---
Following list of commands in only in this branch.

---

* git branch: Shows info about the branches in the repository.
* git checkout branch name: Switch to the branch whose name is given.
- git push origin master: push the content of the comitted file to the remote GitHub repository.
- git remote add origin (address}: This gives the info about where to push the commited gile in remote GitHub.
- git push origin HEAD: It will push the commited file to the branch in which we are because the HEAD implies the branch we are working in.
- git remote -v: gives info about the address to fetch the repo and push to the repo as shown below:
---
This is the result:

---
```
origin  https://github.com/0-BINARY-1/First-Repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/0-BINARY-1/First-Repo.git (push)

```

Now, I will restart my habit of using github for various projects from today. Todays date is 2024-12-25.
